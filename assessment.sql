#   Purpose: Each row of table trucks contains information about a single trucksâ€™ origin (origin), destination (destination) and time of departure (time). 
#	Each row of table products describes a single product and contains information about the warehouse they're traveling from (origin), the store they're traveling to (destination) and the time they will arrive at the departure warehouse (time). Products will be loaded on the earliest possible truck that travels directly to their desired destination. Products can still be loaded on a truck if it departs in the same minute that they arrive at the warehouse's loading bay. All products which are still at the warehouse at 23:59 and are not loaded on any of the 23:59 trucks will stay at the warehouse without being loaded on any truck.
#	You can assume that no two trucks with the same origin and destination depart at the same time.
#	Write an SQL query that, for each truck, returns the number of products loaded on it. For each truck you should provide its id (id) and the number of products loaded (products_loaded). Rows should be ordered by the id column (in ascending order).
#	Time is represented as a string in the format HH:MM.
